# contour_integration_assay

Examine whether a model shows sensitivity to extended contours, and estimate tuning for curvature and length at different spatial frequencies.

Output:
For each layer examined, we output a mask showing which units showed significant sensitivity to extended contours (more 3 or more gabor elements), orientation, lenght, and spatial frequency preference.
